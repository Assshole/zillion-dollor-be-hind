My inspired story of my organs missing and coyote encounter dog attack etc
Chris is going to tell you a animalistic story of a day that changed his idea of off even telling anyone this midlife crisis, and put it in the life story of his own words. To the best of my disability's to proove that through hell and back someone can get help from problems by writing a little short story that tells everything that made them think it was impossible to deal with the humans.
